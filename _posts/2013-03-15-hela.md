'Skloot set up the Henrietta Lacks Foundation with a portion of her book earnings to help the descendants of Mrs. Lacks. Johns Hopkins has neither apologized formally to the family nor offered them any compensation, although to its credit, it has established a lecture series and an annual scholarship in the name of Henrietta Lacks.

Henrietta is immortal. She lives on through the impact her cells have had on humanity. But as her son, David Lacks says, "My mom's legacy is the HeLa cells, and I say yes, it's a part of her that was given and is still giving. But I also let them know she wasn't just her cells, she was a person, a mom and a wife."'

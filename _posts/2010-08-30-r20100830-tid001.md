http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2009/11/pursuing-passion.html
<ul>
	<li>I discovered that passion has an infinite variety of meanings.</li>
</ul>
	<li>I want to use the term more narrowly, to refer to strong emotions that motivate us to move beyond our comfort zone and to achieve the potential that resides within us.  <strong>Passion comes from within each of us</strong>; it cannot be imposed or mandated from outside. <strong>At the same time,</strong> <strong>it compels us to move outside</strong>, to engage with the world around us.</li>
	<li>Passion, in the sense I am using it, orients us</li>
	<li>Passion is about perseverance.</li>
	<li>People with passion are driven to pursue and create. They may read books and observe others, but they are not content being bystanders.  They feel an overwhelming urge to engage, to experience for themselves and to test their own capabilities. Passion compels us to act.</li>
	<li><strong>I am focused on the other kind of passion – the passion of explorers</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Passion is certainly not the same as happiness</strong>,</li>
	<li>Passion comes from the Latin word “pati”,  meaning suffering or enduring.</li>
	<li>Passion is about performance.</li>
	<li>Passion is about progression</li>
	<li>Passion is about connecting</li>
	<li>Passion pulls.</li>
	<li><strong>Passion is not predictable</strong>.</li>
	<li>Passion is about risk-taking.</li>
	<li>Passion is about authenticity.</li>
	<li>Passion is becoming increasingly important for our professional success.</li>
	<li>On the other hand, if passion and profession can be integrated, stress turns into stimulus.</li>
	<li>Most executives have considerable ambivalence about passion</li>
	<li>As a result, it is not surprising that <strong>passionate people often flee the confines of larger firms</strong></li>
	<li>This flight of passion from our institutions is deeply troubling</li>
	<li>passionate individuals are essential to driving the quest for scalable peer to peer learning.</li>
	<li>In fact, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2009/08/defining-the-big-shift.html">Big Shift</a>, <strong>a strong case can be made that the institutions that create a welcome home for passionate individuals will be the ones that thrive in this challenging new world.</strong></li>

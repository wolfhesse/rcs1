dear web, as massive computing will come down to the neighbourhood rather sooner than later, prizewise and processwise, you can start now to introduce yourself to that pattern of survival; militant indirection 3-, 4-way or even more, and scalable weak links: effective distribution of knowledge, goods and services will work either this way, or not at all. same is valid for politics &amp; society at large: either evolutionary change will outperform the dumbs, or we all are going to swiftly meet desaster. genrl signs of danger are any anti-p2p utterance, strong copyright and patent regulatives that destroy innovation, goallessness and nihilism of social media practice [ esp. interacting with thousands of 'close' friends online ], anything that ressembles stuffing, censorship and an uncontrolled police. you did not plan that, i know. i'm sorry to say that this is more of an observation than a prediction, and it is all but simple. have a nice day.

﻿TED University in Long Beach, Tom Wujec talks about how the brain creates meaning and how we can take advantage of that. In the end Wujec suggests we use images in three ways: (1) Use images to clarify ideas. (2) Use images to create engagement with your ideas. (3) Use images to augment memory with persistent and evolving views.</p>
